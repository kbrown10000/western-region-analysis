# Critique: Partner & Alliance Strategy

**Review Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Reviewer:** Strategy Review Board  
**Page:** `/partner-strategy`

---

## Executive Summary

The Partner Strategy page exposes a critically underdeveloped channel that generates just 1.1% of total pipeline. The 2-person team, combined with a 7.5% win rate for the partner lead, suggests this function is either misaligned with strategy or fundamentally broken. The $3M cumulative target by Q4 2026 is reasonable but the path to get there is underspecified and underfunded.

## What's Strong

- **Honest self-assessment**: Calling out 1.1% partner pipeline share and 22.5% blended win rate
- **Clear team performance data**: Kim Guihen's 7.5% win rate is surfaced, not hidden
- **Partner type taxonomy** is well-structured (Technology, Implementation, Associations, OEM)
- **Territory-specific strategy** aligns partner focus with coverage gaps
- **Roadmap has concrete milestones** (quarterly targets, investment amounts)
- **Data source transparency** documenting known MCP issues

## Critical Gaps

### 1. **Kim Guihen's 7.5% Win Rate is a Red Flag** — SEVERITY: HIGH
This is catastrophically low. Company average is 41.6%. Partner lead is converting 7.5%. Either:
- Deal qualification is broken
- Partner-sourced leads are garbage quality
- Kim lacks sales enablement/training
- The role is misaligned (business development vs. deal closing)

**No coaching plan is specified beyond "diagnose."** This person touched 8 opportunities and converted essentially zero. That's not a coaching issue — that's a role-fit question.

### 2. **2-Person Team for $3M Target is Impossible** — SEVERITY: HIGH
The roadmap targets $3M cumulative partner pipeline by Q4 2026. Current team:
- Kim Guihen: 7.5% win rate, $70K pipeline
- Meghan Rutkowski: 37.5% win rate, $536K pipeline

That's $606K total pipeline from 2 people. Reaching $3M requires 5x growth with zero headcount increase. Where's the hiring plan?

### 3. **$200K Annual Investment is Insufficient** — SEVERITY: HIGH
Roadmap shows $200K total investment across 4 quarters. But:
- $150K is earmarked for Cascadia alone
- That leaves $50K for all other partner initiatives (AWS, Azure, ISPE, BIO events)
- Industry partner programs typically require $500K-$1M to launch properly

### 4. **No Partner Economics Model** — SEVERITY: MEDIUM
The page mentions partner ROI ("$2-3M pipeline/year" for tech partners) but doesn't model:
- Referral fee structure
- Revenue share with partners
- Channel conflict resolution
- Deal registration rules
- Minimum commitment thresholds

### 5. **Veeva/Box/DocuSign "Current Partners" Are Vendor Relationships** — SEVERITY: MEDIUM
Listing Veeva, DocuSign, and Box as "current partners" conflates being a customer/implementer with having a formal partner agreement with mutual revenue commitments.

### 6. **Cascadia Strategy is Partner-Only with Zero Backup** — SEVERITY: MEDIUM
Seattle territory is 100% dependent on partner channel success. If partner investment fails, there's no Plan B. What's the trigger to pivot to direct sales?

### 7. **No Partner Performance SLAs** — SEVERITY: LOW
What metrics define a successful partner? No tier criteria, no minimum deal flow requirements, no churn provisions.

## Data Validation

| Claim | Site Value | Expected (from TOOLS.md) | Status |
|-------|------------|--------------------------|--------|
| Kim Guihen Win Rate | 7.5% | Labor MCP roster shows ~7.5% | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Meghan Rutkowski Win Rate | 37.5% | Labor MCP roster shows ~37.5% | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Total Partner Pipeline | $606K | ~$606K (calculated) | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Partner Pipeline Share | 1.1% | $606K / $54.8M = 1.1% | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Team Size | 2 | Growth - Partnership and Alliances dept | ✅ VERIFIED |

**Note:** The data is accurate but damning. Partner channel is negligible.

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Week 1-2)
1. **Performance review for Kim Guihen** — 7.5% win rate requires immediate intervention. Either redefine role (BD vs. closing), provide intensive coaching, or make a change.
2. **Document actual partner agreements** — Are Veeva/Box/DocuSign contractual partners or just vendors we use?

### Short-term (Q1 2026)
3. **Hire Partner Channel Manager** — $3M target is impossible with 2 people
4. **Define partner tier structure** — Gold/Silver/Bronze with clear benefits and requirements
5. **Model partner economics** — What's the referral fee? Revenue share? Deal registration rules?

### Medium-term (Q2-Q3 2026)
6. **Pilot ONE technology partnership** — Don't try AWS, Azure, ServiceNow simultaneously. Pick one, prove the model.
7. **Create Cascadia contingency** — If partner channel fails by Q2, what's the direct sales trigger?
8. **Budget realism check** — $200K is likely insufficient; prepare $500K ask for Phase 2

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Kim Guihen continues at 7.5% | High | High | Immediate role assessment |
| $3M target missed | High | Medium | Reduce target or add headcount |
| Cascadia remains at $0 pipeline | Medium | High | Have direct sales backup plan |
| Partner investments yield no ROI | Medium | High | Stage-gate funding with milestones |
| Channel conflict with direct sales | Low | Medium | Clear deal registration rules |

**Overall Assessment:** The Partner Strategy is aspirational but fundamentally underpowered. A 2-person team with one member at 7.5% win rate cannot deliver a $3M pipeline. Either triple the investment and headcount, or dramatically reduce expectations. The page deserves credit for honesty but lacks the hard decisions required to make this channel work.
