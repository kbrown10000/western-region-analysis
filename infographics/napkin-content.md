## 6. GTM PRIORITIZATION - FROM 13 TO 5

CURRENT STATE: 13 GTM Pillars
Too many for 2 quota-carrying sellers
13 pillars ÷ 2 sellers = Strategic sprawl

RECOMMENDED TOP 5 FOCUS:

1. CLOUD MIGRATION + VALIDATION
   Why: AWS/Azure partnerships, clear ROI

2. AI GOVERNANCE
   Why: Emerging need, limited competition

3. CELL THERAPY MANUFACTURING QA
   Why: San Diego cluster strength

4. DATA INTEGRITY REMEDIATION
   Why: FDA pressure driving demand

5. CSV FOR SAAS
   Why: Veeva/Box partnerships, recurring

DEPRIORITIZE: Lab informatics, training, staff aug, audit support

## 7. THE TURNAROUND REALITY

This is NOT a growth strategy.
This is a TURNAROUND.

WIN RATE: Down from 52% to 41.6% (-11 points)
EXPANSION: 35.6% win rate on existing customers
NEW LOGO: 90.2% win rate (healthy)

KEY INSIGHT:
We're better at landing new customers than keeping them.
This is backwards.

CHALLENGES:

- Win rates falling
- Expansion struggling
- Pipeline stale
- Margins eroding
- Seller concentration risk
