# Critique: GTM Strategy

**Review Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Reviewer:** Strategy Review Board  
**Page:** `/gtm-strategy`

---

## Executive Summary

The GTM Strategy page is comprehensive and well-structured, presenting 13 distinct go-to-market pillars with clear triggers, entry points, and expansion paths. However, it suffers from classic strategic sprawl — trying to do everything at once. With a region in revenue decline and a sales team already stretched, attempting 13 concurrent GTM motions is a recipe for mediocrity. The page would benefit from ruthless prioritization.

## What's Strong

- **Pillar structure is excellent**: Each GTM has triggers, entry point, expansion path, and target criteria
- **AI Governance positioning is timely**: 52% of Bay Area funding to AI companies is a genuine opportunity
- **Existing customer cross-sell identification** (margin recovery + service expansion)
- **Territory-specific target mapping** aligns GTMs with geographic coverage
- **Cloud Assurance → AI Expansion playbook** link shows integrated thinking
- **Quick reference table** at the bottom is highly usable

## Critical Gaps

### 1. **13 GTM Pillars is Too Many** — SEVERITY: HIGH
The page lists 13 distinct GTM motions:
1. AI Governance & Risk
2. Embedded AI Adoption
3. Domain-Led AI Agents
4. Veeva SME Advisory
5. Veeva Managed Services
6. Veeva AI Readiness
7. CRO Oversight & CTMS
8. eTMF Reference Model 2027
9. ProcessX (ServiceNow)
10. GxP Managed Services
11. Operating Model Transformation
12. Data Integration & Digital Foundations
13. Third-Party Risk Management

With 2 Western sellers (Justin and Mike, since Bay is vacant and Cascadia is partner-only), how do they effectively execute 13 different sales motions? This is strategic incoherence disguised as comprehensiveness.

### 2. **No Prioritization Framework** — SEVERITY: HIGH
The page shows 3 "highest-impact" GTMs but doesn't explain why these 3 vs. the other 10. What's the:
- Revenue potential by pillar?
- Win rate by pillar?
- GP margin by pillar?
- Sales cycle length by pillar?
- Competitive differentiation by pillar?

Without this data, the prioritization feels arbitrary.

### 3. **Veeva is 4 Separate Pillars** — SEVERITY: MEDIUM
"Veeva SME Advisory", "Veeva Managed Services", "Veeva AI Readiness", and "Embedded AI Adoption" (largely Veeva-focused) are listed separately. This artificially inflates the GTM count and fragments what should be a unified "Veeva Ecosystem" strategy with multiple entry points.

### 4. **AI Targets Include a Lost Customer** — SEVERITY: MEDIUM
The page lists "Numerion Labs (ex-Atomwise)" as a target with "(Win-Back)" noted. Per TOOLS.md, Atomwise was a $15K LTV customer in 2024. Win-backs have lower success rates than new logos. Why is this positioned as a top AI Governance target?

### 5. **No Sales Enablement Plan** — SEVERITY: MEDIUM
How will Justin Ott and Mike Campbell learn to sell 13 different GTMs? There's no mention of:
- Training curriculum
- Sales playbooks by pillar
- Qualification scorecards
- Demo environments
- Reference customers per GTM

### 6. **"Operating Model Transformation" is Vague** — SEVERITY: MEDIUM
This pillar claims to target "cell therapy companies facing complex regulatory path" but doesn't define what "Operating Model Transformation" actually delivers. Is it org design? Process redesign? Technology implementation? All of the above?

### 7. **Target Mapping Shows Overlap** — SEVERITY: LOW
The same companies appear across multiple GTMs:
- Sana Biotechnology: Cell Therapy Scale-Up AND CRO Oversight AND Operating Model
- Numerion Labs: AI Governance AND TPRM
- National Resilience: Domain-Led AI AND GxP MS AND ProcessX

This isn't wrong, but it needs account planning to avoid confusing the buyer with multiple pitches.

## Data Validation

| Claim | Site Value | Expected (from TOOLS.md) | Status |
|-------|------------|--------------------------|--------|
| AI Targets Count | "varies by pillar" | 7+ companies listed | ✅ REASONABLE |
| Cell Therapy Targets | "12+ funded" | Matches target list | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Numerion Labs (Atomwise) | "Win-Back" | $15K LTV in 2024 | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Veeva Customer Base | "All existing West customers" | Not directly verifiable | ⚠️ PLAUSIBLE |
| National Resilience | "$2B customer" | $6.7K LTV (Finance MCP) | ❌ MISLEADING |

**Critical Finding:** National Resilience is described as a "$2B customer" on the homepage but Finance MCP shows only $6.7K LTV. They may have $2B in funding, but they're a **$6.7K customer**, not a $2B one. This is misleading.

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Week 1-2)
1. **Reduce GTM count to 5 priorities** — AI Governance, Veeva Ecosystem (consolidated), GxP MS, CRO Oversight, Operating Model
2. **Kill or defer 8 GTMs** — ProcessX, eTMF 2027, Data Integration, TPRM, Domain AI, Embedded AI (merge into Veeva AI) can wait
3. **Correct National Resilience messaging** — they're a $6.7K customer, not $2B

### Short-term (Q1 2026)
4. **Create sales playbooks for top 5 GTMs** — one-pagers with triggers, qualification, demo, pricing
5. **Map each Western account to ONE primary GTM** — avoid pillar confusion
6. **Define success metrics per pillar** — pipeline generated, win rate, ACV, GP%

### Medium-term (Q2-Q3 2026)
7. **Training rollout** — equip sellers before expecting multi-GTM execution
8. **Pilot expansion** — prove 5 GTMs work before reintroducing deferred pillars
9. **Account planning discipline** — no account gets pitched 4 different services simultaneously

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Sellers can't execute 13 GTMs | High | High | Reduce to 5 priorities |
| GTM confusion at customer | High | Medium | One primary GTM per account |
| No differentiation between pillars | Medium | Medium | Clear positioning and boundaries |
| Training lag delays execution | Medium | Medium | Playbooks before Q1 close |
| Win-back targets fail | Medium | Low | Separate win-back strategy |

**Overall Assessment:** The GTM Strategy page is a masterpiece of completeness but a failure of prioritization. Presenting 13 GTM pillars to a depleted sales team in a declining region is strategic overload. The board should demand a "Top 5" shortlist with clear rationale, success metrics, and a sequenced rollout plan. Attempting everything at once will achieve nothing.
